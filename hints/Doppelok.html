        The idea is to find the correspondence between one hour and one degree, between one minute and one degree.
         After that, just calculate the angle of inclination, taking into account that 18:00 is 180 degrees, and 6:00 is 0 degrees.

        Let's start with the preparation of our input line before calculation. We will transfer to the variables "h"
        and "m" the values of hours and minutes, respectively, already converted to the integer data type using
        the map() and int() functions. The form of recording through coma "h, m = map(int, ...)" is equivalent
        to the next form "h = int(...)" and "m = int(...)". We use the int() function to each item of the split
        line using the separator ":".
        <pre class="brush: python">
time = "07:00"
h, m = map(int, time.split(':'))
print(h)
print(m)

# Output:
# 7
# 0

        Let's move on to the calculation formula. Hours and minutes correlate to degrees as follows: 6 hours = 90
        degrees, so 90/6 = 15, 1 hour is 15 degrees; 6 hours = 360 minutes = 90 degrees, so 90/360 = 0.25, 1 minute
        is 0.25 degrees. 6:00 = 0 degrees, then when calculating, we need to take it into
        account by taking away 90 from the result. The formula will be as follows.
        <pre class="brush: python">
time = "07:00"
h, m = map(int, time.split(':'))
angle = 15 * h + m * 0.25 - 90

        You have to write the condition of if you will return either the result, if the sun is visible,
        or the phrase "I don See the sun!", If the sun is not visible. We use the ternary operator for this purpose.
        <pre class="brush: python">
time = "07:00"
h, m = map(int, time.split(':'))
angle = 15 * h + m * 0.25 - 90
print(angle) if 0 <= angle <= 180 else print("I don't see the sun!")

# Output:
# 15.0

        All you have to do is wrap your code in a function, and add our if condition to the return expression.
        <pre class="brush: python">
def sun_angle(time: str) -> Union[float, str]:
    h, m = map(int, time.split(':'))
    angle = 15 * h + m * 0.25 - 90
    return angle if 0 <= angle <= 180 else "I don't see the sun!"

        The formula is the same as in our decision, but instead of dividing the line into components of the list, it is simply used
        slicing.
        <pre class="brush: python">
def sun_angle(time):
    t = int(time[:2]) * 15 + int(time[3:]) / 4 - 90
    return t if 0 <= t <= 180 else "I don't see the sun!"

        Look at this solution. With the help of the datetime module, we can perform our calculation in time units,
        and only then translate the value into angle units.
        <pre class="brush: python">
import datetime
def sun_angle(time):
    start=datetime.datetime.strptime("06:00","%H:%M")
    end=datetime.datetime.strptime("18:00","%H:%M")
    time=datetime.datetime.strptime(time,"%H:%M")
    diff=(time-start).seconds/60*0.25
    return diff if start<=time<=end else "I don't see the sun!"
        </pre>
    </div>
